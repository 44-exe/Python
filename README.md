# Python
Some python code I learnt and worked on.

Exercise-44.py adds the largest numbers from top to bottom, but is only allowed to choose numbers that are adjacent to the previous number.

Magic-8-Ball.py uses random number generator to answer the question asked.

typing-test.py runs for 60 seconds, you have to type the random given word without a mistake to get a score, any mistakes will give you an error.
